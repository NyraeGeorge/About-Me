# Nyrae George Data Portfolio 👩🏾‍💻 

I am a Data Analyst who is passionate about uncovering insights that drive smart business decisions. What fuels me most is the problem-solving nature of data, digging deep into messy datasets, asking the right questions, and finding stories others may overlook.

I thrive on digging into datasets, identifying patterns, and presenting results through intuitive dashboards and reports. Whether it’s optimizing a process, highlighting trends, or supporting strategic initiatives, I love using data to solve problems and create value. Above all, I’m endlessly curious. 

## Tools I Work With
📊 Excel | 🗄️ SQL | 🐍 Python | 📈 Power BI | ⚙️ HTML

With these tools, I aim to ask the “why” behind the data and push to deliver insights that are not just informative, but impactful. Always learning. Always curious. Always looking for new ways to turn numbers into knowledge is the key to success.
